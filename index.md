#A dataset of bystander facial reactions to human and robot failures.

We introduce the Bystander Affect Detection dataset -- a dataset of videos of bystander reactions to videos of failures. This dataset includes 2452 human reactions to failure, collected in contexts that approximate "in-the-wild" data collection -- including natural variances in webcam quality, lighting, and background.
This project is part of a collaborative research effort between Cornell Tech (PI: Associate Professor Wendy Ju) and Accenture Labs.

Our video dataset may be requested for use in related research projects. As the dataset contains facial video data of our participants, access can be requested along with the presentation of a research protocol or data use agreement that protects participants.
